[LSPosed Framework](https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed)

A Riru / Zygisk module trying to provide an ART hooking framework which delivers consistent APIs with the OG Xposed, leveraging LSPlant hooking framework.

Supported Versions
Android 8.1 ~ 13 Beta 1

* Install
    1. Install Magisk v23+ (Riru) / v24+ (Zygisk)
        (For Riru flavor) Install Riru v25+ from Magisk repo
    1. Download and install LSPosed in Magisk app
    1. Reboot

* Lauch & Shortcut
    * Some launchers won't show a prompt but silently add the shortcut
    * If the shortcut cannot be added, you can install the manager located at `/data/adb/lspd/manager.apk` manually
    * If you accidentally deleted the shortcut, reboot your device or install the manager manually to add the shortcut again
    * If you don't need a shortcut, install the manager manually and you can disable future shortcut being added in the settings
    * In any case, you can dial `*#*#5776733#*#*` (aka LSPosed) to launch the manager if you have a dialer


## Xposed vs Edxposed vs LSPosed

* Xprivacy 过时了。
* LSPOSED + XPRIVACYLUA 
* `Magisk` v24.1, `LSPosed` v1.7.2, `Shamiko` v0.4.3, `XPrivacyLua` v1.30, `Universal SafetyNet Fix (kdragon)` v2.2.1 and everything is working perfectly.
* `Shamiko` is developed to hide traces of magisk, lsposed and zygisk.
    `Shamiko` is not aimed at passing safetynet. She's just for hiding root. Hiding root does not necessarily mean passing safetynet.
* Xposed is an API.
* XPrivacyLua is a xposed module.
    * LUA is the language programming of XPrivacyLua.
* SPatch and SandVXP framework
* lsposed有一个免root实现的分支，叫做lspatch


* Magisk v24.3, LSPosed v1.8.1, Shamiko v0.4.4, XPrivacyLua v1.30, Universal SafetyNet Fix v2.2.1 
    ENABLE Zygisk, ENABLE DenyList and DISABLE Enforcing DenyList

Do NOT expect SHAMIKO to be open source ! It will keep the source closed, because as @topjohnwu already said it's a cat-and-mouse game.
