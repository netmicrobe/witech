For BSD or GNU `grep` you can use `-B` num to set how many lines before the match and `-A` num for the number of lines after the match.

`grep -B 3 -A 2 foo README.txt`

If you want the same number of lines before and after you can use `-C` num.

`grep -C 3 foo README.txt`

This will show 3 lines before and 3 lines after.
