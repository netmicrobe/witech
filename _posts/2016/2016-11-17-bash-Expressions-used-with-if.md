[ -g FILE ]	True if FILE exists and its SGID bit is set.
[ -h FILE ]	True if FILE exists and is a symbolic link.
[ -k FILE ]	True if FILE exists and its sticky bit is set.
[ -p FILE ]	True if FILE exists and is a named pipe (FIFO).
[ -r FILE ]	True if FILE exists and is readable.
[ -s FILE ]	True if FILE exists and has a size greater than zero.
[ -t FD ]	True if file descriptor FD is open and refers to a terminal.

[ FILE1 -nt FILE2 ]	True if FILE1 has been changed more recently than FILE2, or if FILE1 exists and FILE2 does not.
[ FILE1 -ot FILE2 ]	True if FILE1 is older than FILE2, or is FILE2 exists and FILE1 does not.
[ FILE1 -ef FILE2 ]	True if FILE1 and FILE2 refer to the same device and inode numbers.
[ -o OPTIONNAME ]	True if shell option "OPTIONNAME" is enabled.
[ -z STRING ]	True of the length if "STRING" is zero.

Note that `[[` is actually a command/program that returns either 0 (true) or 1 (false). Any program that obeys the same logic (like all base utils, such as grep(1) or ping(1)) can be used as condition, see examples.
